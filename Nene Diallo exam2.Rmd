#Conclusion: The p-values support the significance of age, education, and income as predictors of mental health. Although the model's R-squared value (0.06877) is low, indicating that there are other factors not included in the model, the findings underscore the importance of socio-economic factors in determining mental health outcomes.

#Q4A: 
#The variables I choose are marital status, race, and the number of children, as I think family dynamics play a huge role in the mental health reported in the data. These variables seem exogenous because they are not likely to be directly influenced by poor mental health. However, there may be interactions between marital status, family size, and mental health, as having children or being married could affect stress levels and access to emotional support."


MEN_Marr <- lm(MentalHealth_01 ~ Race + Children + Age_midpt + income_midpoint, data = Sub)
summary(MEN_Marr)

#The estimates from the regression are plausible, as they align with expected relationships in existing research. The negative effect of having children on mental health, for instance, makes sense due to the added stress of caregiving. The negative coefficient for age also fits with the idea that older individuals may face more health challenges that could impact mental well-being. All variables in the model—race, children, age, and income—are statistically significant, suggesting strong evidence that these factors are associated with mental health. However, the model explains only a small portion of the variation in mental health, indicating that other unmeasured factors may also play a role.

#Predicted Probabilities: The predicted probabilities from the model indicate that the factors included—such as education levels, number of children, and race—have a limited ability to predict mental health outcomes, as shown by the small R-squared value of 0.01071. The confusion matrix reveals that the model struggles with both false positives (21,869) and false negatives (40,669), meaning it misclassifies a significant number of individuals. Specifically, the model overpredicts mental health issues for some individuals who don't actually have them (false positives) and fails to identify many individuals who do have mental health challenges (false negatives).
